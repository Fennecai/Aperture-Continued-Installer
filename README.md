# Aperture Continued Installer
This is simply the AutoHotkey-based installer program for https://github.com/Fennecai/Aperture-Continued

I created this to assist players in installing updates who have previously struggled with doing so.

Before using this installer; Please unsubscribe from the addon in the steam workshop, otherwise there is a chance that the installer will simply fail to be of any help.



To use this, simply download the repository as a zip and run the .exe inside.

instructions:

1. click the big green button in the top right corner of this page
2. click "download as zip"
3. when the zip file has finished, extract it anywhere you want
4. go to where you extracted the zip and run the "ApertureContinued-install.exe"
